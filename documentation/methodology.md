# Methodology

The following document will describe the methodology used by the group, to develop this mandatory assignment within the course og Development of Large Systems.
The group consists of four members:
* Burim Syla
* John Kinyua Muriuki
* David Mugwanya Ssezibwa
* Casper Guldbech Nielsen

Given that all members have part time jobs and some kids, it was not natural to go by a fixed methodology for developing this system. It came more natural to go by a concept that leans towards "Community driven development" in the sense that we have weekly meetings, either being by physical presence or by digital presence.
The meetings consists of delegating the work that needs to be done in the order that the team (community) finds important.

## Why not agile, Scrum or XP?

While an agile methodology would be a better fit than any rigid form of development methodology, it it still demanding presence and participation in ceremonies that drive the given or chosen framework to work as inteded. While it do give clear benefits to host these ceremonies, it do not seem fit for the team to go about the project in this way, at least not at the time being.

It is important for each member to be able to work with the project in the time most convenient for him. For some, that means the weekends,for others it means the nights or on the run. It is not important that members of the team participate equally throughout the week, but it is important though, that each individual member takes responsibility for the tasks deemed important by the team. Contribution should be at the convinience of each individual member, as long as the focus is still on accomplishing the task given.

## Community driven development

While it is not completely true to the meaning, we lean further towards community driven development than any other type of methodology for developing software.
It was not directly chosen by the group to do so, it just "happened" in the way that before we could look around, we were already doing development and documentation as needed by the community, rather than what tasks was most fun to do. 

Therefor, we prodly announce that the methodology for developing the first mandatory assignment for Development of Large systems, is no methodology however, not anarchy or chaos but the beauty of comming together as a small community whom has a common goal; To deliver the best possible solution for the assignment while still being able to go on about our daily lives.
